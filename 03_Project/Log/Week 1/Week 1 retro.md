## What went well?
 - Example: We used the pomodoro technique and we were able to get a good overview of the assignments.
 - Communication between the teammembers that helped fill in the gaps when I didn't knew where to turn to.

## What could have gone better?
 - Example: We took a bit too long on our standups and wasted time.
 - Use the time properly to read or watch through the sources to not overlook the answer.
 - Work more towards the desired structure.

## What can we do to improve?
 - Example: We could use a more efficient way of doing the standups.
