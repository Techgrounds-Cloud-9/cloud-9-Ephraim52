# Git-02 Markdown
Creating a document in a Markdown editor

## Key terminology
Markdown
Markup

## Exercise
Making a Markdown document, the content doesn't matter from how I read it.

### Sources

### Overcome challenges
I did the assignment twice just to be sure I did it properly. I made one document in HTML code and the other one with Markdown preview in VSc. I kept looking for a way
to put an image in the Markdown document and I decided it was best to use the URL from the website instead of setting a relative path. Which didn't want to work to save
some time for doing the other assignments.

### Results
A short HTML document with a head, paragraph and some random text.
The second document in Markdown language containt a head, some text and an image URL.
