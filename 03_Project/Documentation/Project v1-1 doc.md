# Project V1.1 Documentation

This project has two versions v1.0 and v1.1. V1.0 is the basis required to build v1.1 on.

## Key terminology
Runtime error= Happens when attempted to run a program or code that functions/creates a program.

IndexError=The Python IndexError: list index out of range can be fixed by making sure 
any elements accessed in a list are within the index range of the list. This can be 
done by using the range() function along with the len() function.

parameter=

def=

## Exercise
- For v1.0 I read the epics and filled it out in the requirements document.
- The same goes for v1.1 which I added in the same requirements document.
- Create a webserver and admin server to the specifics of the customer.

## Sources
Too many...

## Overcome challenges
Every error had to be solved one at a time. At some point I even remade my project v1.0.

## Results
Results will be shown in the presentation 27th of January 2023.
