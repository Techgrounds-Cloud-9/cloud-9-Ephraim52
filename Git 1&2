## Exercise
### Sources
The assignment itself
Google for finding explantion on key terminology words

### Overcome challenges
Once I figured out how to clone the files/code in the GitHub desktop how to push it into my repository on the Github Browser. I couldn't figure out that I had to 
commit my files/changes and my teammate Wim explained it after sharing my screen where I showed my problem. I realize this wasn't the idea on doing the assignment, I
should have looked further into the key terminology words to realize what needed to be done to finished this assignment.

### Results
It looks the same as the repository that our peer has. Peer can check my created repository.
