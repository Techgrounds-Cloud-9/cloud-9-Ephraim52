# Variables
Learning how to work with variables and what they can do.

## Key terminology
None at the moment.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Create a variable and assign a value to it.
- Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.
- Change the value of that same variable.
- Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.
- Change the value of that same variable.
- Print the text “Value 3: <value 3 here>”.

### Results
This is what I printed in the terminal:
