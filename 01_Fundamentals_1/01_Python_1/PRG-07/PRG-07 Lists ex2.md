# Lists
How to make lists with multiple values and how index works.

## Key terminology
Please look at PRG-04 Loops which contains the relevant terminology for this exercise.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Create a list of five integers.
- Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:
- Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).
