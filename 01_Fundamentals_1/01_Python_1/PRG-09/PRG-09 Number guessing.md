# Mini project Python - Number Guessing
Create one of the three following games:

- Number Guessing
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Tic-Tac-Toe

## Key terminology
import= to import the information to a file or information from the file to the code as output.

while loop= infinite loop as long as the condition you set is True or any other statement.

variable= a container with information/data that you can use for other commands.

value= is the input inside of the container of a variable.

input= you can ask for the user to input information by: variable = input("What is your name?") To which you can answer with any name and the output will be your name as that is what you put into the variable.

True & False= True - if, False - else or vice versa. These are combined a lot also named Booleans this evaluates any value and checks if it is true or false.

Integer= int() this represents whole numbers not decimals like 5,75. 

String= "insert text here" contains text information which you can later on combine with other functions such as print(String).

If & else= Often used to create the conditions True or False, to make the statement on whether something is true of false but also there are many other conditions. Smaller and bigger than are a few more of that category.

## Exercise
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (or any other range).
- The player guesses a number. For every wrong answer the player receives a clue.
- When the player guesses the right number, display a score.

### Overcome challenges
Need to add tips when the user guessed wrong, so I put that in the same box as the first box in the while loop where it keeps asking your guess. Displays the tips when you guessed wrong and specifies if it needs to be lower or higher then your guess.

### Results
The number guessing game with tips added:

The coding.
