# Loops
How loops work and how to make them.

## Key terminology
See the first exercise of PRG-04.

Value= A value is like a letter or a number you add these to the code like with variable: a = 10, then the variable 'a' has the value '10' added to it. Starts at 0 never goes 10 or above.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.
- Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
- Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
- Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

### Overcome challenges
Changing the range as I got confused about the variable 'i' which was 0. Without assigning a value to 'i' I figured I would need to change the range.

### Results
The value of 'i' is 0 +1 untill its becoming 9 it doesn't count to 10 just 0 to 9.

Variable x added and changed the range to roud it up to the 10th. So it would iterate for 50 times.
