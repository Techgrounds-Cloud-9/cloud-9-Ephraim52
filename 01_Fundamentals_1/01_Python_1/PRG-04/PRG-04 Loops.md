# Loops
How loops work and how to make them.

## Key terminology
While loop= Is a repetative loop until the condition of the variable is false or equal can go on infinitly.

For loop= Is a loop used to jump through repeatable objects until the variable is done for.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

### Overcome challenges
None for this one.

### Results
Here I made an executed the new script where I made a while loop go until it was equal to 10.
