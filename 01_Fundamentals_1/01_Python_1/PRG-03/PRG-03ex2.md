# Data types and comments
How to determine data types and how to read/write comments.

## Key terminology
See PRG-03ex1 because there these terms are mentioned.

Input= A function for asking a user to send information to the program, that might even be further used to go to the next step in the program.

Output= Is the input function what the program adds to the input the user gave. for example a question is: How old are you? being the output, you put in your age 65.
The final output will be the output of the program, the question and the print that might say: You are (65) years old. That would be all the output as an example.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
- Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).

### Overcome challenges
None on this part luckily.

### Results
I also made sure it showed the class as it was explained in the video the output will always be a string, it can't add up different classes.
