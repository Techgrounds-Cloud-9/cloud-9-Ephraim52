# Data types & comments
How to determine data types and how to read/write comments.

## Key terminology
Bolean= A binary state that is either True or False.

String= Technically an array of characters. Strings are denoted using “ ” double quotes or ‘ ’ single quotes.

int= An integer is a whole number. Ints can be both positive and negative.

float= A floating-point number is a decimal number.

## Exercise
- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.
- Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
- Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
- Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

### Overcome challenges
How to make the integer and string add up together.

### Results
After some struggle on figuring out how to get x to float I worked it out as followed.

This is an image with the data types.

Here I added the comments as well as solving the floating issue.
