# Pricing
Study how AWS does their pricing.

## Key terminology
Capex= Capital expenditures represents the expense(s) an organization or company makes to produce or maintain assets/services. Example: Buildings, vehicles or land.

Opex= Operational expenditures are the costs of keeping the building operational, for example the building needs electricity for you to work in and water for the restrooms. The printer would be capex, but the paper, ink and electricity would be opex as you need those to keep the printer operational.

TCO= Total Cost of Ownership is the total amount it costs direct and indirectly for the service/product.

S3= Simple Storage Service used to store any amount of data use any services to manage the storage and data.

EC2= Elastic Compute Cloud is a virtual machine that represents a physical server to deploy your applications with. 

## Exercise

AWS free tier for:
- S3
- EC2
- Always free services
- Understand the differences between capex and opex

### Overcome challenges
None just reading a lot

### Results
Four advantages of the AWS pricing model:

- Pay-as-you-go
- Save when you commit
- Pay less by using more
- Benefit from massive economies of scale

Three fundamental drivers of cost for AWS:

- Compute
- Storage
- Outbound data transfer

The difference between capex and opex is if I purchase a building I would pay fixed amount of money each month to own the building. Opex would be the electricity as I would need to keep my employees productive as their operating machines use electricity.
