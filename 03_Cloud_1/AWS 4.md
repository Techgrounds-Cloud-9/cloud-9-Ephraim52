# Core Services
Get to know the different services for the Cloud Practicioner Exam.

## Key terminology
Amazon EC2= Elastic Compute Cloud that offers resizable compute capacity for virtually any workload. This contains multiple instances which you can use, processor, storage, networking, operating system in order to create the model that matches the needs of your workload to the best solution possible.

AWS Lambda= This is a serverless event-driven compute service that allows you to run any code for any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.(SaaS)

Compute= Calculate which computers do faster than us humans or in other phrases it can be used to say something adds or doesn't add up. 

SaaS= Software-as-a-Service means that Software applications are being delivered through the internet as a Service.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk= A Service for scaling and deploying web applications and services. Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring. 

Amazon VPC= Virtual Private Cloud you can work with different resources in this Virtual Isolated Network. In the Isolated Network you can control resource placement, connectivity and security.

Amazon Route 53= Is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises. Customize your DNS routing policies to reduce latency, improve application availability, and maintain compliance.

Amazon S3= (S3) Simple Storage Service is object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. You can easily manage features, organize data, optimize costs, configure access controls to meet complaince requirements from organizations or businessess.

Amazon S3 Glacier= a secure and durable service for low-cost data archiving and long-term backup. It is cost-effective and you don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.

Amazon CloudFront= A content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience.

Amazon RDS= Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Or have them on-premises with AWS Outposts.

Amazon DynamoDB= Is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools.

NoSQL= NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as “not only SQL” and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

Amazon CloudWatch= Collects and visualizes real-time logs, metrics, and event data in automated dashboards to streamline your infrastructure and application maintenance. Observe and monitor AWS resources and applications in the cloud and on premises

Amazon CloudFormation= This  is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. (IaaS)

IaaS= Infrastructure-as-a-Service provides compute, memory, storage, networking and related software, such as operating systems and databases, as a cloud service to replace traditional on-premises data center infrastructure.

AWS Identity and Access Management= With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.
