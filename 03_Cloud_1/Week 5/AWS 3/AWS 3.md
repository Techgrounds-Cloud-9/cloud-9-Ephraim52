# The advantages of the Cloud
Study the six advantages of the Cloud.

## Key terminology
For Capex and Opex check exercise AWS 2.

API= Application Programming Interface, defines how two applications communicate with each other.

Partition= dividing a division into smaller portions.

## Exercise
- Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

You should be able to explain all six points, as well as recognise synonyms.

### Overcome challenges
Reading.

### Results
- Security

Ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data globally, you always control your data. This is monitored 24/7 as well as automatic encrytion at the physical layer when data is outbound.(Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers)

- Availability

Each region has availability zones which contains isolated partitions which are parts of the AWS infrastructure. This way you can locate issues faster, also you can use the control planes and the management console of the region you are working in.(Benefit from massive economies of scale)

- Performance

Because AWS has divided its infrastructure over Regions the packet loss is low as well as the latency. Further having a 100 GbE fiber network as the backbone for providing capacity between regions speeds up the transfer of data.(Increase speed and agility)

- Scalability

The ability to scale up and down the amount of resources needed for the bussiness on a day to day basis. To reduce the cost and optimize efficiency of the resources required.(Stop guessing capacity)

- Flexibility

Choosing how and where you want to run your workloads. By using the AWS regions you can run your applications globally or if you like on premises you can choose AWS Outposts. (Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx))

- Global Footprint

When deploying your applications and workloads to the cloud, you have the flexibility in selecting a technology infrastructure that is closest to your primary target of users. You can run your workloads on the cloud that delivers the best support for the broadest set of applications. (Go global in minutes)
