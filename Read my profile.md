- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ephraim52/aka Dominic
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Github, Linux, Cloud and I really like history. I could fill your day with facts!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT fundamentals, Linux and Cloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current work and study.
- 📫 How to reach me you can always find me under my alias Ephraim52. FB pm or Discord pm.

So what else is there to say, I study languages and history in my free time on occossion. I like gaming we could collab on that too, as for sports 
I hope to pick canoeing back up in the future. 

Currently studying Cloud engineer and so far so good, I hope to kickstart my new future and career with this. As the world changes we people are subject 
to those changes...

I just hope to come out on top to achieve the dream imprinted in me house, tree, pet as we would say in Dutch; Huisje, boompje, beestje. Being happy is 
the most important part about this. When I collab with people I do my best to leave positive thoughts and memories behind.
