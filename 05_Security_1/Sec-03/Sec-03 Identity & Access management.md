# Identity & Access management
Studying the differences and uses of Identity and Access management.

## Key terminology
MFA= Multi-Factor authentication, it is an access method where the user needs to go through two steps for getting access.

## Exercise
- The difference between authentication and authorization.
- The three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security.
- What the principle of least privilege is and how it improves security.

Just searching for information about all this.

### Results
The difference between authentication and authorization is that authentication verifies the identity of a user or service and the authorization part looks at which access rights this user or service is allowed to have.

The three factors of authentication are:

- Something you know, like your username and password or even security questions you use to login in with. (authenticate yourself)

- Something you are, like your fingerprints, face, eyes. Often mobile devices use these to allow you to login to your mobile device with your fingerprint, facial recognition or scanning your iris. Simply this way contains all your biometric data.

- Something you have, like a keycard, hardware tokens, single use passwords that you receive through text message or e-mail. This helps reducing the risk of losing these physical items.

MFA improves security because its not only username and passwords you got other ways of identifying yourself. To protect you from social engineering or social hacking. (phishing e-mails) Like two-step authentication where you use your username & password and the second step being a physical key send through text message or e-mail.

The (POLP) principle of least privilege means that users have limited access only to what they need to do. Like only read instead of read & write a file. 

It improves security because it decreases the chances of cyber attacks, preventing the spread of malware, it also helps to keep track of who has access to what data if someone tried to get access with being authorized.
