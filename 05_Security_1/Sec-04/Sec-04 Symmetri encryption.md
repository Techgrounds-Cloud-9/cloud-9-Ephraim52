# Symmetric encryption
[Give a short summary of the subject matter.]

## Key terminology
Symmetric encryption= A form of encrypting/decrypting your data/file using a single key.

Caesar cipher= An encryption technique which Julius Caesar used for encrypting his messages. You use it by replacing the original letter in your text by for example 4 steps back in the alphabet. A, B, C, D, E, F: D would be Z for example as that would be 4 steps back from the letter in the text with E starting at A.

## Exercise
- Find two more historic ciphers besides the Caesar cipher.
- Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.
- Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. 
You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. Analyse the shortcomings of this method.

### Overcome challenges
Deciding on which cipher to use and in which order to add this for encrypting the key.

### Results
Two other historic encryption ciphers:

The use of Hieroglyphs and the Enigma machine.

- Hieroglyphs used by the Egyptians as their way of writing.

- The Enigma machine used by the Germans in World War 2 for encrypting their messages. Looking like a typing machine it was designed and set to code messages.

Two digital ciphers still being used today:

TLS and SSL, both share similarities.

For the last part of this exercise I transferred my excel sheet into an encrypted .zip file. The password being encrypted with a cipher and a slight hint in the .zip file name.
