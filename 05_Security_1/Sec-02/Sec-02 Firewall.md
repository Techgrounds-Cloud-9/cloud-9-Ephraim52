# Firewall
learning about firewalls and what they do. How firewalls work.

## Key terminology
Stateful firewall= This firewall monitors the full state of active network connections, so it is constantly analyzing the complete contents of the traffic and data packets when seeking entry to a network.

Stateless firewall= Does not inspect traffic, instead looks if the packets are conform with the security rules. This kind of firewall protects you less than the stateful firewall.

CentOS= Community Enterprise Operating System is a Linux distribution providing open-source community supported computing platform.

iptables= Is a part of the Linux kernel firewall the iptables set up, maintain and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 to filter packet rules.

## Exercise
- Installeer een webserver op je VM.
- Bekijk de standaardpagina die met de webserver ge√Ønstalleerd is.
- Stel de firewall zo in dat je webverkeer blokkeert, maar wel ssh-verkeer toelaat.
- Controleer of de firewall zijn werk doet.

I used man iptables to look up the description in Linux.

### Overcome challenges
In my Linux machine the firewall seemed to be inactive. Looked for information about how to activate this had to use the sudo ufw enable command, I checked this by using man ufw which showed all the options and explained all options as well. 

Couldn't seem to get into the website I made on Linux, but in the end I found out I needed the public ip instead of the hostname ip.

### Results
First part was installing and setting up Apache after that I checked the standard webpage in the editor to be sure everything was ok. To configure the firewall settings I had to use sudo ufw commands.

Here you see the website how I wrote it in Linux and a view of the website online with just some text. To achieve this I made a few seperate new files: content.html (contains the html code for the website) and host_example.conf. Along with the directories host_example and html which is located in /var/www/host_example/html/content.html is the absolute path. For finding the website in the webbrowser I used the public IP address of the host along with the port.

The firewall is now blocking traffic while allowing ssh connection and checking the website:
