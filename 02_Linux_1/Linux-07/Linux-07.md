### Overcome challenges
Exercise 1:

I was struggling to get the httpd script running I tried executing it using my username and a password which I didn't know. I solved the problem by putting sudo in the command lines so that upon executing the httpd script it would run without question, which it did.

Exercise 2:

The problem was that it wouldn't generate a random number but instead add the line $randomNumber. Later on by removing the quotations it worked and added the random number.
