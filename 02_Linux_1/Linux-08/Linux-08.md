# Cron Jobs
Create script to automate writing the current time, date & available disk space to specified files named in the exercise.

## Key terminology
Cron = a job scheduling utility if you use specific syntax you can configure a cron job to schedule commands to run automatically

Df = a command to see the disk space available

(-)H = shows the amount of bytes listed by 1000. For example 1000B = 1kb = 1 kilobyte

(*) = any value can be filled in here for example 0 â€“ 9 

` = not a quotation, but anything you typ between the backtick will be evaluated and executed by the shell


## Exercise
- Create a Bash script that writes the current date and time to a file in your home directory.
- Register the script in your crontab so that it runs every minute.
- Create a script that writes available disk space to a log file in '/var/logs'. Use cron job so that it runs weekly.

The presentation about Cron jobs helped me. I would like to mention that and thank them for that.

### Overcome challenges
One of the challenges I had was to figure out why it wouldn't execute the script in which I typed the command: today='date'. It wouldn't execute the date command because quotations don't do executions of commands. 

So I looked up what did execute commands in this manner and found out that the backquote/backtick `` does this.
